1) Each player may only select a square that exists on the “Map” (A1, B3, C4, G7, H9, etc.)
2) A square can only be selected once (i.e. you cannot ‘dig’ in the same place more than once)
3) If the player finds some treasure, then the value will be added to his/her “Pirate Points”
4) If the player does not find any treasure, then they do not score any “Pirate Points”
5) In all cases, 1 is subtracted from the Player’s “Dig Points”
6) Now move to the next player and repeat the process.
7) If a Player has no “Dig Points” left, then they miss their turn.
8) If all the treasure is found, then the game is over.
9) If no player has any “Dig Points” left, then the game is over.
