# PIRATE PETE’S TREASURE HUNT GAME

At the start of the game, the user should be asked to enter the number of players in the game.
### VALIDATION RULE: 
   - There has to be a minimum of 2 players and a maximum of 4 Players
Next, the user should be prompted to enter the full name and age of each player in the game (one
player at a time)
### VALIDATION RULE: 
    - The player has to enter their name in one line and must enter a first name and
surname
### VALIDATION RULE: The player’s age must be 12 or over
    - Next, the game should (briefly) outline the rules of the game for the players. These are explained
below (See “Game Rules”).
    - Each player should be awarded 100 “Pirate Points” to start the game. Then the game should
randomly give each player a number of “Dig Points”
### VALIDATION RULE: The number of “Dig Points” must be a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 7.
    - Now subtract “Pirate Points” from each player based on their “Dig Points” x 5 – for example, if Player
One gets 3 Dig Points, then subtract 3 x 5 = 15 from their “Pirate Points”, so Player One now has 85
“Pirate Points” at the start of the game.
The game should then create a “Treasure Map” and display it on the screen. This will be a 10 x 10
grid of squares. The grid must be labelled so that the rows are numbered 1 to 10 and the columns
are labelled A to J. This is so that the player can easily select a square.
